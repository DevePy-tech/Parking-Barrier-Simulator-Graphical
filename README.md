# Parking-Barrier-Simulator-Graphical
Graphical version of Parking Barrier Simulator

The tkinter parking entrance is an visual version of the Parking entry manager. So instead of using your keyboard you'll use the buttons on the screen. 

If you want to use the one with the barrier gate, use entry manager server
and parking entrance client. It has visual button and the two programs work on the port 8080(localhost)

How do I use the Server-Client script? 

First run ParkingEntryManagementServer

then run TkinterParkingEntranceClient

next press "Press for ticket"

after that the server wil receive a signal and the gate will start opening

Enjoy !
